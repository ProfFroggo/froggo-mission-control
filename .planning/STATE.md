## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 0: Next.js App Router chosen (not Pages) — SSR + API routes in one process
- Phase 0: `better-sqlite3` kept — same DB file at `~/froggo/data/froggo.db`, zero migration
- Phase 0: `window.clawdbot` compat shim strategy — bridge.ts polyfills IPC → fetch, migrate components incrementally
- Phase 0: SSE for streaming (not WebSocket) — simpler, works natively with Next.js API routes
